#### Task: 
More stakeholders are coming to us for data, which is great! But we need to get some more models created before we can help. Create a marts folder, so we can organize our models, with the following subfolders for business units:
• Product -- required
• Core -- optional
• Marketing -- optional 

#### Additional task:
Within each marts folder, create intermediate models and dimension/fact models.
